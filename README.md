This Python program allows for the management of student records through functionalities such as registration, search, display, and updates. The interaction with student data is facilitated by reading and writing to the "student_db.txt" file where the information is stored. Below are the key features and instructions related to using the system.
## Features:
1. Registration:
    - Add new student information to the database, ensuring unique student IDs are entered.
2. Search Student:
